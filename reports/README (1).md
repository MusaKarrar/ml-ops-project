# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is auto
generated in the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image to
the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

will generate an `.html` page of your report. After deadline for answering this template, we will autoscrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate an `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final handin.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

will check your answers in this template against the constrains listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, have you included an image when asked to.

For both functions to work it is important that you do not rename anything. The script have two dependencies that can
be installed with `pip install click markdown`.

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustic* which means that it includes everything that you could possible do on the project in
relation the curricilum in this course. Therefore, we do not expect at all that you have checked of all boxes at the
end of the project.

### Week 1

* [*] Create a git repository
* [ ] Make sure that all team members have write access to the github repository
* [ ] Create a dedicated environment for you project to keep track of your packages
* [ ] Create the initial file structure using cookiecutter
* [ ] Fill out the `make_dataset.py` file such that it downloads whatever data you need and
* [ ] Add a model file and a training script and get that running
* [ ] Remember to fill out the `requirements.txt` file with whatever dependencies that you are using
* [ ] Remember to comply with good coding practices (`pep8`) while doing the project
* [ ] Do a bit of code typing and remember to document essential parts of your code

* [ ] Build the docker files locally and make sure they work as intended
* [ ] Write one or multiple configurations files for your experiments
* [ ] Used Hydra to load the configurations and manage your hyperparameters
* [ ] When you have something that works somewhat, remember at some point to to some profiling and see if
      you can optimize your code
* [ ] Use Weights & Biases to log training progress and other important metrics/artifacts in your code. Additionally,
      consider running a hyperparameter optimization sweep.

* [ ] Create a trigger workflow for automatically building your docker images
* [ ] Get your model training in GCP using either the Engine or Vertex AI
* [ ] Create a FastAPI application that can do inference using your model
* [ ] If applicable, consider deploying the model locally using torchserve
* [ ] Deploy your model in GCP using either Functions or Run as the backend

### Week 3

* [ ] Check how robust your model is towards data drifting
* [ ] Setup monitoring for the system telemetry of your deployed model
* [ ] Setup monitoring for the performance of your deployed model
* [ ] If applicable, play around with distributed data loading
* [ ] If applicable, play around with distributed model training
* [ ] Play around with quantization, compilation and pruning for you trained models to increase inference speed

### Additional

* [ ] Revisit your initial project description. Did the project turn out as you wanted?
* [ ] Make sure all group members have a understanding about all parts of the project
* [ ] Uploaded all your code to github

## Group information

### Question 1
> **Enter the group number you signed up on <learn.inside.dtu.dk>**
>
> Answer:

--- 25 ---

### Question 2
> **Enter the study number for each member in the group**
>
> Example:
>
> *sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX*
>
> Answer:

--- S204161, s220044 ,s230432 ,s223092, s184213  ---

### Question 3
> **What framework did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer:

--- We use pyTorch for training our model. We were able to create neural networks (a CNN and vision transformer (structure from https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)). We used the package nn from torch for creating the neural networks. With Torch, we were able to create Transformer blocks and then let the number of transformer blocks be a hyperparameter - this would have been much more difficult if coding a ViT using numpy only. Optimizers, loss functions & dataloaders were also predefined from torch. Einops was used for the vision transformer. We also used W&B for logging data we get from the models. ---

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

---  We used conda for managing our dependencies. The first thing everybody did was to create a conda environment for this project & this helped with avoiding conflict errors. We used ‘pipreqs –force’ to generate a requirements.txt, which we then went through to make sure that the dependencies looked OK.. The new group member needs to have access to the git repository first, then clone the project. Then for the new group member to get a copy, we would use ‘pip install -r requirements.txt’ to ensure they have the right dependencies to run all the code. 
The exact commands are:
#create conda env
conda create –name ml-ops-env python=3.10
conda activate ml-ops-env
git clone https://github.com/MusaKarrar/ml-ops-project.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, to get the EXACT copy one would pull the docker images we have built (on Cloud build).---

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. Did you fill out every folder or only a subset?**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
> Answer:

--- The scripts we run to perform the experiment are in a src folder, while the data and results are outside of it such as figures from visualizations and confidential raw and processed data. This data cannot be acquired through the public github repository and can only be acquired with an agreement with the company providing the data. The results from wandb runs are also outside the src folder. We filled out configs, tests, updated dockerfiles, added folder for W&B info… The folders we did not fill out are notebooks, documentation for src (docs folder). We have also added a “bfg.jar” file outside the src folder, which is the repo cleaner progam just in case that the confidential data gets committed to the github repository to remove past commits. ---

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? Additionally, explain with your own words why these**
> **concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Answer:

--- 

We agreed that we would try to be PEP8 compliant (but we are mere mortals…). Because it can cause problems when many people work on a big project. If unlucky, one can spend a whole day debugging and find out that the error is because a capital S should have been used somewhere instead of a lowercase s amongst thousands of lines of code. We implemented typing in CNN class but ran out of time.   
 ---

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

--- We have implemented 3 tests. In test_data,py we test whether the data has been loaded in correctly, by asserting if the shape is (N_obs,4,160,106). Where N_obs is a list defined in the config file [N_train,N_test] =  [120,40]. The test is not hardcoded to a single file, so assuming all training_images are named with the prefix ‘training_images’, then test_data.py would make sure that all N_train observations exist across all the training files. same for test files. test_construction.py makes sure that the image shape is divisible by the patch shape in both image dimensions (these shapes are defined in config_model.yaml). test_training_model.py makes sure that the loss of the trained model on test set is not unrealistically bad. ---

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If you code had an code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

--- Total coverage is 76%. 2 testfiles have 100% and the 3. tesfile has 95%. ‘coverage report -m’ reveals that the line in test_training.py, which is missing is line 41 where the CNN is defined inside an if-statement. Line 41 is not used because ViT is chosen and so line 41 is not triggered and coverage drops. model.py has coverage 70% (both models are defined in same python script, CNN function not triggered) and predict_model.py has coverage 27%. If coverage was 100%, then it does not mean code is error free - it only means that all lines of codes are triggered and used for something. Coverage would still be 100% for example if the test accuracy was incorrectly divided by a random number. ---

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in*
> *addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...*
>
> Answer:

--- Everyone had a branch they worked on, so we had 6 branches in total including the master branch. Some used the website to merge with after pulling and pushing to their own branch, while others used VS Code for pulling, pushing and merging. VS Code had a merging tool that was utilized by a few members. One member used github desktop for pulling, pushing and merging. For too complicated/big changes, the terminal or VS Code was used for merging. For everyone to be up to date, everyone will be pulling from the master branch, as that is the branch we ensure to be our up to date that does not have any major issues with the files and code. ---

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**
>
> Answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our*
> *pipeline*
>
> Answer:

---  We did make use of DVC to manage the data and models in our project. It helped us resolve the issue of uploading confidential data to the github repository, since we wanted the github repository to be publicly available, considering it is a project assignment, but not the data. Therefore the data is stored through Google Drive privately through DVC. It was however not needed for storage efficiency, which is what DVC is great for. Well, it does help in terms of reproducibility, as it ensures the same data is used all the time throughout the experiments of models we have. For the future, it can also help us track the data, in case of changes of data, that is going to be made, or perhaps when we have a lot more models or data with larger file sizes, DVC is pretty useful. We then used google cloud buckets instead. ---

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continues integration setup. What kind of CI are you running (unittesting, linting, etc.)? Do you test**
> **multiple operating systems, python version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free to insert a link to one of**
> **your github actions workflow.**
>
> Answer length: 200-300 words.
>
> Example:
> *We have organized our CI into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing and one for running*
> *... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen here: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

--- We have tested different operating systems. MacOS and Windows were tested and both operating systems could run the code without problems. We tried to test it on Ubuntu, but there are some errors, as it should have been done within minutes. Currently, we can conclude that it is not working properly on Ubuntu for now., Our workflows are defined in our YAML file. We did not upload the data to github, which is why some of the workflow tests failed, specificly it tries to find the data in test_data.py, which is one of our 3 unit testing files (we also have test_construction.py and test_training.py). The YAML of our problem can be found here.
We used linting (with ruff-package) on our src files & fixed most of the linting issues.
Docker is also set up with version control, so every time an update/commit is made & when a VM is enabled in the Compute Engine, then a new docker image is built and saved to the docker registry in Cloud build.
We only tested for python version 3.10/3.11, since most of the members either had python version 3.10 or 3.11. The most important aspect is to ensure that everyone could work on their python environment.

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.

### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run a experiment.**
>
> Answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: python my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

--- While the approach to be followed by default was to use an argparser, we created a configuration file called config_model.yaml, created for listing the hyperparameters of both models used in our code i.e. the Vision Transformer as well as the CNN. While some hyperparameters were kept specific to each model and defined under their respective sections i.e. hyperparameters_ViT and hyperparameters_CNN, there were a few that could be defined under defaults as they were common to both. OmegaConf was then utilized in the training code(training_model.py) to call each one of these variables/constants whenever necessary.
The following code snippet illustrates how OmegaConf was utilized for using hyperparameters while decoupling them from the mainstream model definition code:
